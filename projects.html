      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        I wanted to create an app concept that meaningfully improves safety for people unable to safely
        call 911 — including domestic violence victims, students, gig workers, and individuals with disabilities.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        Develop a complete startup pitch including problem definition, user research, revenue model, and 
        a business model canvas. The idea needed to be realistic, scalable, and socially impactful.
      </p>

      <h4>Action</h4>
      <p>
        I built Dial: a silent emergency-alert app that allows users to send a discreet 911 alert with GPS 
        and optional audio/video capture. I created market segmentation, TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, a subscription 
        model for individuals, and a B2G licensing model for police and government agencies.
      </p>

      <h4>Result</h4>
      <p>
        The pitch received strong feedback for clarity, professionalism, and impact. The project strengthened 
        my skills in problem-framing, market sizing, and business communication.

      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        For a multi-module supply chain case study, I analyzed the Remington 870 shotgun — a highly 
        recognizable product with a complex component-based supply chain and multiple global supplier inputs.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        Map the entire supply chain, evaluate supplier performance, diagnose defects, create procurement 
        KPIs, and propose improvements to quality, sourcing, and inventory planning.
      </p>

      <h4>Action</h4>
      <p>
        I broke down each major component (receiver, barrel, stock, trigger group, coating) and documented 
        suppliers, cost structures, defect patterns, and delivery performance. I built a supplier scorecard 
        that highlighted a critical issue: a 5% defect rate from Criterion Barrels. I proposed corrective 
        action plans and a performance-based supplier improvement program.
      </p>

      <h4>Result</h4>
      <p>
        The final case study earned strong praise for clarity, depth, and realism. The scorecard design, 
        global sourcing insights, and quality recommendations were highlighted as standouts.

    <h3>Reverse Psychology in UX – Bias in Design</h3>

      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        In my UX class, I was tasked with creating a visual explainer that demonstrated a psychological 
        bias used in design. I selected “Reverse Psychology” because it appears frequently in popular apps.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        Research real-world examples, explain the bias clearly, and design a clean, accessible educational 
        piece using CRAP visual design principles.
      </p>

      <h4>Action</h4>
      <p>
        I built a carousel-style presentation that broke down what reverse psychology is, why it is used, 
        and the difference between ethical persuasion and manipulative dark patterns.
      </p>

      <h4>Result</h4>
      <p>
        The project strengthened my understanding of ethical UX communication and taught me how to simplify 
        psychological concepts into clean, digestible visual content.
