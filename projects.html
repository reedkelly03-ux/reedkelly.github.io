  <h2>Projects & Case Studies</h2>
  <p class="projects-intro">
    These are the projects that best represent how I think, build, and lead — from creating a
    socially impactful emergency app concept to breaking down a real firearm supply chain and
    exploring psychology in UX design. Each case study follows a Situation, Task, Action, and
    Results structure so you can see not just <em>what</em> I did, but <em>how</em> I approached it.

      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        In my entrepreneurship class, we were challenged to create a realistic business idea and pitch
        it to the entire class. I didn’t want to build just another convenience app — I wanted something
        with real impact. After looking into gaps in public safety technology, I realized how many
        people, like domestic-violence victims, students, and gig workers, don’t always have the ability
        to safely call 911. That insight sparked the idea for Dial: a silent emergency-alert app.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        My task was to turn that rough idea into a complete, credible business pitch. That meant defining
        the problem, mapping target users, sizing the market, designing core features, and building a
        revenue model that served both everyday users and government agencies — all in a way that felt
        grounded, not gimmicky.
      </p>

      <h4>Actions</h4>
      <p>
        I researched how emergency response systems work today and built Dial’s value proposition around
        what they miss: silent activation, automatic GPS location, and instant camera/mic capture for
        evidence. I mapped out B2C customer segments (victims, students, gig workers, people with
        disabilities) and B2G customers (police, EMS, public safety departments). I used a business model
        canvas to connect key activities, partners, and resources, and I built a slide deck that
        summarized everything from TAM/SAM/TM to pricing strategy: a low-friction subscription for
        individuals and licensing contracts for agencies.
      </p>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        The pitch landed really well. My classmates and professor said it felt both innovative and
        practical and highlighted the social impact as a differentiator. The project gave me confidence
        in turning a vague idea into a structured business concept and showed I could communicate a
        complex, sensitive topic in a way that felt clear, human, and actionable.

      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        In my Supply Chain Management course, our final case study required us to pick a real product
        with a complex production and logistics process and break down its entire supply chain. I chose
        the Remington 870 shotgun because it has a long history, multiple specialized components, and a
        mix of domestic and global suppliers — enough moving parts to really test my ability to map an
        end-to-end supply chain.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        My task was to build a full report covering demand, supplier strategy, quality management,
        inventory planning, global sourcing, KPIs, risk mitigation, and future recommendations. The goal
        wasn’t just to describe the current state, but to evaluate it and propose realistic, data-backed
        improvements that Remington could act on.
      </p>

      <h4>Actions</h4>
      <p>
        I started by mapping each major component — steel for receivers and barrels, wooden and synthetic
        stocks, triggers, springs, and coatings — and identifying key supplier types, from Carpenter
        Technology and Criterion Barrels to stock manufacturers and coating providers. Using Porter’s
        Five Forces and voice-of-customer inputs, I identified where Remington needed to excel:
        reliability, on-time delivery, cost control, and regulatory compliance. From there, I built a
        supplier performance scorecard with KPIs like on-time delivery, defect rate, and cost variance,
        and called out a major issue: Criterion Barrels’ 5% defect rate versus a <1% target. I proposed
        supplier development programs, joint quality initiatives, and performance-based incentives to
        close that gap. I also analyzed inventory patterns across regions and seasons, explored global
        sourcing options for components, and mapped risks like material cost swings and shipping delays
        to mitigation strategies.
      </p>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        The final report was thorough and well received. My professor specifically highlighted the
        supplier scorecard, the analysis of Criterion’s defect rate, and the global sourcing
        recommendations. The project helped me build confidence in breaking down a complicated supply
        chain into understandable pieces and reinforced how critical supplier relationships, quality
        control, and risk planning are in real operations work.

    <h3>Reverse Psychology in UX – Bias in Design Project</h3>
    <div class="project-subtitle">UX Design Course Visual Project · Senior Year</div>
    <div class="project-tags">
      <span class="tag">UX Design</span>
      <span class="tag">Psychology</span>
      <span class="tag">Visual Storytelling</span>

    </div>

  <div class="project-layout">
    <div class="project-stars">
      <h4>Situation</h4>
      <p>
        In my UX class, we were asked to pick a cognitive bias, UX law, or dark pattern and turn it into
        a visual educational piece — something like a LinkedIn carousel, Instagram reel, or TikTok short.
        The goal was to show how psychology influences design while applying CRAP principles for visual
        clarity. I chose Reverse Psychology in Design because I kept seeing it in everyday apps and
        wanted to unpack how it nudges user behavior.
      </p>

      <h4>Task</h4>
      <p>
        My task was to research reverse psychology, find credible sources and real-world examples, and
        transform that into a concise visual story. I needed to define the concept, explain why designers
        use it, show real examples, and end with ethical guidelines — all in a format that was easy to
        scan, visually consistent, and engaging.
      </p>

      <h4>Actions</h4>
      <p>
        I pulled from psychology and UX sources to define reverse psychology and why it drives engagement,
        then chose two concrete examples: Duolingo’s streak-loss notifications and AdBlock’s playful
        “Don’t install AdBlock” messaging. I storyboarded the flow — hook, definition, why it’s used,
        examples, and a “Do/Don’t” ethics slide — and then built the full carousel in Canva using a
        consistent blue palette, clear hierarchy, and strong contrast. Each screen focused on one idea,
        with short copy and supporting visuals. After a draft round of peer feedback, I revised the copy
        and layout to make the examples and takeaways even clearer.
      </p>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        The final piece clearly showed how reverse psychology shows up in real interfaces and how it can
        quickly cross the line into manipulation if misused. I walked away with a stronger sense of how
        subtle design decisions influence user behavior and how to communicate complex concepts visually
        without overwhelming people. It also made me more aware of the psychological tricks I encounter
        in my own apps, which will make me a more thoughtful designer and consumer.
