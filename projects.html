  <h2>My Projects</h2>

  <!-- DIAL PROJECT -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Dial — Silent Emergency Response App</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">
      In my entrepreneurship class, we were tasked with creating a realistic business idea and pitching it to the entire class. I wanted to build something meaningful—not just another generic app—so I researched gaps in public safety technology and realized how many people (domestic-violence victims, students, gig workers, etc.) don’t always have the ability to safely call 911. That insight became the foundation for Dial, a silent emergency-alert application.
      <br><br>
      I turned the idea into a structured business model by defining key customer segments, mapping technical requirements, building the value proposition, and designing a dual revenue model: subscription plans for individuals and licensing packages for government agencies. I also built a polished pitch deck that clearly explained the problem, solution, and market opportunity.
      <br><br>
      The pitch was well received—my classmates and professor said it felt both innovative and practical. This project strengthened my ability to turn a raw idea into a credible business case and communicate it in a human, impact-focused way.

  <!-- REMINGTON PROJECT -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Remington 870 Supply Chain Management Case Study</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">
      In my Supply Chain Management course, I chose the Remington 870 shotgun as the focus of my final case study because of its complex manufacturing process, diverse components, and mix of global and domestic suppliers. It was a great product to analyze from raw materials all the way to finished goods.
      <br><br>
      My objective was to evaluate demand patterns, supplier performance, quality management, global sourcing decisions, inventory planning, and risk mitigation. I mapped out the major components and suppliers, built a supplier scorecard, analyzed the competitive landscape using Porter’s Five Forces, and tied everything back to customer expectations.
      <br><br>
      A key finding was a 5% defect rate from Criterion Barrels—well above the sub-1% benchmark. I recommended supplier development initiatives, joint quality programs, and performance-based contracts to address this. I also explored global sourcing options and inventory strategies to balance cost, reliability, and service levels.
      <br><br>
      The case study was recognized for its depth and clear recommendations, and it gave me hands-on experience using tools like scorecards, KPIs, and sourcing strategy to drive real operational improvements.

  <!-- BIAS IN DESIGN PROJECT -->
  <div class="project-section">
    <h3>Bias in Design — Reverse Psychology in User Interfaces</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">
      For my UX Design course, I created a visual educational project focused on Reverse Psychology in digital interfaces. I researched the bias using credible psychology and UX sources, identified real-world examples like Duolingo’s streak loss notifications and AdBlock’s “Don’t install AdBlock” prompt, and then designed a LinkedIn-style carousel to explain how it works.
      <br><br>
      The final design walked through what reverse psychology is, why it influences user behavior, where it commonly appears in apps, and how designers can use it responsibly without crossing into dark patterns. The project improved my ability to communicate complex UX and behavioral concepts visually, and it made me more aware of how subtle design decisions shape user choices.
