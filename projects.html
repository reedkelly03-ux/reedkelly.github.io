        <!-- Project 1: Dial -->
        <article class="project-detail-card">
          <h2>Dial: Silent Emergency-Alert App</h2>
          <p class="project-meta">Entrepreneurship · Junior Year Individual Pitch</p>
          <div class="project-body">
            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>
              In my entrepreneurship class, we had to create a realistic business idea and pitch it to the
              entire class. I didn’t want to build just another generic app. After looking into gaps in
              public safety technology, I realized how many people — like domestic-violence victims, students,
              and gig workers — don’t always have the ability to call 911 safely. That insight sparked the idea
              for Dial, a silent emergency-alert app.
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
              My job was to turn that rough idea into a complete, credible business pitch. That meant defining
              the market, designing the core features, and proving the concept could actually work in practice.
            </p>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>
              I researched how emergency response systems work today and used that to build out Dial’s value
              proposition. I mapped customer segments, tech requirements, and a revenue strategy that included
              individual subscriptions and licensing for government agencies. I also built a slide deck and
              practiced explaining the problem in a way that felt real and human, rather than overly technical.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The pitch landed well. My classmates and professor said it felt both innovative and practical,
              and that the social impact made it stand out from other projects. The experience gave me more
              confidence in turning an idea into a structured business model and communicating a complex
              concept in a clear, purposeful way.

        <!-- Project 2: Remington 870 Case Study -->
        <article class="project-detail-card">
          <h2>Remington 870 Supply Chain Case Study</h2>
          <p class="project-meta">Supply Chain Management · Sophomore Year Capstone Case</p>
          <div class="project-body">
            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>
              In my Supply Chain Management course, our final case study required us to select a real product
              with a complex production and logistics process and break down its entire supply chain. I chose
              the Remington 870 shotgun because of its long history, specialized components, and mix of
              domestic and global suppliers — enough moving parts to really test my analytical skills.
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
              I was tasked with creating an end-to-end supply chain report that covered demand, supplier
              strategy, quality management, inventory patterns, global sourcing, KPIs, risk mitigation, and
              potential improvement projects.
            </p>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>
              I mapped major components like steel, barrels, stocks, and triggers and identified where they
              came from and which suppliers were involved. I used Porter’s Five Forces to analyze the
              competitive landscape and the voice of the customer to highlight performance priorities.
              From there, I built a supplier scorecard, evaluated inventory by region and season, and explored
              global sourcing options for cost and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key insight was that Criterion Barrels had a 5% defect rate — far above the &lt;1% benchmark.
              I proposed supplier-development programs, joint quality initiatives, and performance-based
              incentives to improve consistency and reduce defect-related costs. I also identified risks like
              material cost fluctuations and shipping delays and paired each with practical mitigation strategies.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The final report was well-received, and my professor highlighted the supplier quality analysis
              and global sourcing recommendations as strengths. The project reinforced how important supplier
              relationships, quality control, and risk planning are in real-world operations.

        <!-- Project 3: Bias in Design UX Project -->
        <article class="project-detail-card">
          <h2>Reverse Psychology in UX Design</h2>
          <p class="project-meta">UXD Class · Bias in Design Visual Project</p>
          <div class="project-body">
            <h3>Situation</h3>
            <p>
              In my UX class, we were asked to choose a cognitive bias, UX law, or dark pattern and turn it
              into a visual educational piece (like a LinkedIn carousel or Instagram reel). I chose
              <em>Reverse Psychology in Design</em> because I kept seeing it in apps I use every day and wanted
              to understand how it nudges user behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>
              My task was to research reverse psychology, find credible sources and real examples, and turn
              that into a clear, visually structured carousel. I needed to define the concept, explain why
              designers use it, show real examples, and end with guidance on using it ethically.
            </p>

            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>
              I researched the bias using psychology and UX sources, then collected examples like Duolingo’s
              streak-loss notifications and AdBlock’s “Don’t install AdBlock” prompt. I storyboarded the flow:
              a hook, definition, “why it’s used,” examples, and a do/don’t slide. Then I built the carousel
              in Canva, applying consistent colors, typography, and alignment while using contrast to highlight
              key messages.
            </p>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>
              The final design clearly showed how reverse psychology appears in everyday interfaces and how
              easily it can cross the line into dark patterns if misused. I came away with a stronger
              understanding of the psychology behind interfaces and improved my visual storytelling and layout
              skills.
